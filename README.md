Return Of Zork's Survivor Solver

It's called Survivor, in honor of Wizard Trembyle and Canuk.
The only two survivors of The Great Diffusion.
That happend over 400 years ago.
You've got 16 squares.
I play the Wizard and you can play the Canuk.
So the wizard has got to move one square strait and one square diagonal in each move.
It can move diagonal first and strait afterwards.
It doesn't matter.
And the moment the Wizard moves off a square, it caves in and forms a pit.
Now Canuk can jump to any unoccupied square and far sure to move into a pit and he's won.
And the object is to have all the squares turned into pits, except the one you will be sitting on.
That takes strategy.
