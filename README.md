Return Of Zork's Survivor.

Source: http://zork.wikia.com/wiki/Survivor

Survivor is a game for two players, played after The Great Diffusion. The players play as either Wizard Trembyle or Canuk. The Wizard must move on square back or forward in one direction, and two in the other. When the Wizard moves off a square it caves in, forming a pit. Canuk can move to any unoccupied square on the board. The object of the game for the Wizard is to make all the squares pits apart from the two occupied squares. The object for Canuk is to force the Wizard to move into a pit. The Wizard may,however, pass his movement turn.
